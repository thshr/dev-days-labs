Explore mobile development with free training courses from Xamarin experts and local community members. Then, after lunch, get the opportunity to put new knowledge into practice by building a cross-platform, cloud-connected app with Xamarin and Azure in Visual Studio.

Inside this repo you will find all of the presentations, demos, and hands-on labs that you will experience at Xamarin Dev Days!
